Description:
Dark Web Activation Windows is an advanced security script designed to protect your computer from various threats, including malware, viruses, and potential attacks originating from the dark web. The software integrates with Windows Defender to perform comprehensive system scans, enabling real-time protection to prevent ongoing threats. Dark Web Activation Windows offers a variety of protection plans, ranging from free short-term options to premium lifetime plans. Users can select their desired protection plan and, in the case of the premium plan, receive a unique activation key.

This tool ensures that Windows is fortified with not only antivirus protection but also additional layers of security, such as enabling Windows Firewall, activating TPM (if available), and providing country-specific IP-based protection to block users from restricted locations. Additionally, users can track the status of their system’s protection via a simple, user-friendly interface.

Key Features:
- **Protection Plan Selection:** Choose from protection durations ranging from 14 days to 24 months.
- **Advanced Antivirus Protection:** Automatically scans the system using Windows Defender and provides comprehensive malware detection.
- **Real-Time Protection:** Monitors and blocks active threats using Windows Defender’s real-time protection features.
- **Firewall Activation:** Automatically enables Windows Firewall to prevent unauthorized network access.
- **Additional Security Layers:** TPM (Trusted Platform Module) activation (if supported by the system) to enhance system security.
- **Geographical Protection:** Uses IP-based security to block access from specific countries, enhancing protection against threats from restricted regions (e.g., Russia, China).
- **Premium Protection:** A paid "Parliament" plan offering lifetime protection upon entering a valid activation key.

Price and Payment Options:
Dark Web Activation Windows provides a range of protection plans.
The "Parliament" premium protection plan requires a paid activation key, which can be purchased in different currencies (USD, EUR, BGN).
Pricing is based on the plan selected, with lifetime protection available for a one-time payment.
The tool allows users to choose from various currencies to suit their location (USD, EUR, or BGN).

Minimum Requirements:
- Compatible with Windows versions 7, 8, 10, and 11.
- Requires administrative rights for the script to run properly.
- Active internet connection for certain features (such as IP-based protection and online activation).

How It Works:
After installation, users can select their desired protection plan. For free plans, the tool automatically activates Windows Defender and performs a full system scan to detect and remove threats. Paid plans, such as the "Parliament" plan, require entering a unique activation key, after which users will receive lifetime protection and access to all advanced features.

The software also ensures that security measures are in place, such as real-time scanning and blocking potential attacks. The geographical protection feature can block users based on IP location to ensure that access to the service is restricted from potentially harmful regions.
