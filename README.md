Description:
Dark Web Activation Windows is an advanced security script designed to protect your computer from various threats, including malware, viruses, and potential attacks originating from the dark web. The software integrates with Windows Defender to perform comprehensive system scans, enabling real-time protection to prevent ongoing threats. Dark Web Activation Windows offers completely free protection plans with full security features.

This tool ensures that Windows is fortified with not only antivirus protection but also additional layers of security, such as enabling Windows Firewall, activating TPM (if available), and providing country-specific IP-based protection to block users from restricted locations. Additionally, users can track the status of their system’s protection via a simple, user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

Protection Plan Selection: Choose from protection durations ranging from 14 days to 24 months.

Advanced Antivirus Protection: Automatically scans the system using Windows Defender and provides comprehensive malware detection.

Real-Time Protection: Monitors and blocks active threats using Windows Defender’s real-time protection features.

Firewall Activation: Automatically enables Windows Firewall to prevent unauthorized network access.

Additional Security Layers: TPM (Trusted Platform Module) activation (if supported by the system) to enhance system security.

Geographical Protection: Uses IP-based security to block access from specific countries, enhancing protection against threats from restricted regions (e.g., Russia, China).

How It Works:
After installation, users can select their desired protection plan. The tool automatically activates Windows Defender and performs a full system scan to detect and remove threats. It also ensures that security measures are in place, such as real-time scanning and blocking potential attacks. The geographical protection feature can block users based on IP location to ensure that access to the service is restricted from potentially harmful regions.

Download the script and extract it to your system.

Create a folder in your Windows directory called DarkWeb. The full path should be:

Once this is done, you can execute the script directly from PowerShell to activate the protection features.

Make sure you have administrative rights to execute the script.
